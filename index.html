  <article>
    <h2 id="one">This is a Heading</h2>
    <p>This is a paragraph.  It has a couple of sentences.  Each sentence is different and adds to what is being said.  We could have used a lorem ipsum generetor but such clich√©-ridden antics are not our style.</p>
    <p>This is another paragraph which is a little longer than the first one. This paragraph also contains multiple sentences.  As before the sentences are written in English using characters in typed on a keyboard.  This sentence may even have been narrated using speech to text.  How it got here doesn't matter.  What is said doesn't matter.  It all just exists to be formatted.</p>
    <section>
      <h3 id="two">This is a Heading in a sub-section</h3>
      <p>This is a paragraph in a sub-section.  Sub-sections are just nested section elements.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h3 id="three">This is a Heading in a another sub-section</h3>
      <p>These subsections are nice, and this one contains an unordered list.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Sub-section item one.</li>
        <li>Sub-section item two (last item).</li>
      </ul>
    </section>
  </article>

  <article>
    <h2 id="four">This is a second article</h2>
    <p>This is a very short paragraph.</p>
    <p>This is another paragraph.</p>
    <p>This is a third paragraph which is longer than the first two. This paragraph contains just two sentences.</p>
